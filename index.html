        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p><img id="profile" src="assets/images/profile.jpg"/>I know what you’re thinking. And yes, it was "<i>just</i> okay. Kinda salty.” Turkey leg aside, welcome to my online portfolio. My name is <b>Rosa Garcia</b> (which you’ve probably already guessed by the logo). I’m an aspiring full-stack developer living in Dallas, Texas.</p><br>
        <p>Before being seduced by the sweet allure of loops and arrays, my heart belonged to technical writing. You know those manuals you throw aside when you want to get to the thing you bought? That stuff's tech writing, albeit a gross oversimplification. I still love tech writing, but let’s just say we’re on a break.</p><br>
        <p>But back to coding: my first experience with web development happened many years ago (ca. 2005), back when inline frames were all the rage. AOL was sending trial CDs and people were asking Jeeves. What a time to be alive! Fast forward to now, and I’m relearning how to build a web site the better way. Thank goodness for Bootstrap!*</p><br>
        <p>In addition to HTML and CSS, I’m also learning Java and JavaScript. In my free time, when I’m not trying to figure out why one of my divs won’t float left, I spend my time still trying to figure out why my one of my divs won’t float left. To be totally honest, I don’t really have hobbies… unless not having hobbies is a hobby, which in that case, I have a hobby!</p><br>
        <p><i>*Ironically, no Bootstrap was used in the building of this site. It was all me and lots of coffee.</i></p>
